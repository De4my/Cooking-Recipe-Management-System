# Cooking-Recipe-Management-System

Cooking Recipe Management System was a system I developed during my workshop I course. This course's task is to develop a simple system using C++ language only. Cooking Recipe Management System (CoRE) was a  place/platform for food lovers, beginner chefs, and culinary experts to dive into to share experiences and gain knowledge on making beautiful dishes using various recipes.

## Motivation project
CoREC was developed because of my passion for culinary arts and inspired by most of the cooking shows such as Masterchef and famous influencer which is @khairulaming. Despite all the recipes seen through all these channels, it would be amazing if there was a place for people to look for the recipe that they would like to try on.

## Project Overview
CoREC is a small system that consists of two roles; chef and admin. The chef is someone who can share and read all the recipes available while the admin is someone who can also create and approve new users. Admin is someone who has the privilege of managing the system and solving the issue that arises.
