## Project Background
This project manages all recipes that have been inserted by the user. The system allows users to see whole new recipes and include some old recipes, hence it will also show ranking based on the rating. This system is developed to be beneficial to the user for searching recipes in one place. Hence, it will help users pick the recipe they want to try. In addition, the system also provides the details for every recipe so it will be a guideline for new users to try to cook. This system also adds its recipe and shares it with other users. This will create a community and give exposure to new users to try the recipes that have been added. Finally, the system is just a platform for users to share, rate and manage their recipes. It also gives feedback through ratings to get an overview of the recipe that has been approved, which will allow the user to improve their recipe.

## Problem Statement
A common problem when searching for a recipe to cook is that we cannot see the outcome of it, hence it will also be hard for users including new users to find a good recipe in one place. It is because there are a lot of recipes on the internet or in a reference guide such as a book, or magazine. Next, it will take a long time to search for any recipe that is suitable for the user especially for new users because of a lack of experience in cooking. The guide on the reference given could not help much for new users to understand. In addition, users have to trial and error to determine whether the recipe is suitable, easy to implement, and the outcome of the recipe. There was also no community to ask in terms of tips, guides, precautionary steps, and many more. Even though there are still some guidelines provided it will not be explained in detail about the recipe. It will be time-consuming for users to try each of the recipes they found on the internet or in reference books. Finally, if the user wants to share any of their recipes it will be hard for them to find a place to contribute to another user.This will cause less variety in some of the recipes for new users to try out.
